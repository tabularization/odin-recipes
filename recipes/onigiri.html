    <h2>Traditional Japanese Onigiri</h2>

    <p>
      Onigiri, a beloved traditional Japanese snack, offers a delightful combination of simplicity and flavor. The process of
      making onigiri is a cherished culinary art that involves shaping freshly cooked rice into compact, hand-held triangles,
      balls, or cylinders. The rice itself, often short-grain Japanese rice, is cooked to perfection, resulting in a slightly
      sticky texture that holds the shape of the onigiri. The fillings, ranging from grilled salmon to pickled plum or cooked
      tuna, provide bursts of flavor and variety, enhancing the overall taste experience. The act of shaping the onigiri with
      moistened hands brings a sense of craftsmanship and personal touch to the process, making each rice ball unique.
      Whether enjoyed as a quick snack on the go or as a satisfying component of a bento box, onigiri offers a comforting and
      familiar taste of Japan's culinary heritage.
    </p>
    <p>
      What sets onigiri apart is not only its delightful taste but also its versatility. The fillings can be tailored to suit
      individual preferences, allowing for endless creative combinations. The compact size and convenient shape of onigiri
      make it a perfect portable snack, ideal for picnics, lunch boxes, or a quick bite during a busy day. The addition of a
      strip of nori seaweed, when wrapped around the rice, adds a subtle umami flavor and a contrasting texture that further
      elevates the overall experience. Onigiri's simplicity and practicality have made it a staple in Japanese cuisine for
      centuries. Whether enjoyed as a nostalgic treat or introduced to new culinary explorers, onigiri represents a charming
      and delicious embodiment of Japan's culinary traditions, offering a delightful and satisfying snack that can be enjoyed
      anytime, anywhere.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sushi rice or short-grain Japanese rice</li>
      <li>Nori seaweed sheets</li>
      <li>Fillings of your choice (e.g., grilled salmon, pickled plum, cooked tuna, etc.)</li>
      <li>Salt (for seasoning your hands)</li>
      <li>Water (for moistening your hands)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook the rice: Rinse the sushi rice or short-grain Japanese rice thoroughly until the water runs clear. Cook the rice
        according to the package instructions or using a rice cooker. Once cooked, let the rice cool slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the fillings: While the rice is cooling, prepare the fillings you'd like to use for your Onigiri. Common
        choices include grilled salmon, pickled plum, cooked tuna, or any other flavorful ingredient that suits your
        preference.
      </li>
      <li>
        Moisten your hands: Fill a small bowl with water and add a pinch of salt. Moisten your hands in the salted water.
        This step helps to prevent the rice from sticking to your hands and adds a subtle seasoning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shape the Onigiri: Take a small handful of rice and place it in the palm of your hand. Make an indentation in the
        center and add a small amount of your chosen filling. Gently mold the rice around the filling, shaping it into a
        triangle, ball, or cylindrical shape. Ensure the rice is tightly packed and the filling is completely enclosed.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you prefer, you can wrap the Onigiri with a strip of nori seaweed. Simply cut a nori sheet into thin strips and
        wrap it around the base of the Onigiri, securing it in place.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat and vary fillings: Repeat the process with the remaining rice and fillings, creating as many Onigiri as
        desired. Feel free to experiment with different fillings for a variety of flavors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve and enjoy: Onigiri is typically eaten at room temperature. You can enjoy them immediately or pack them for a
        picnic or lunch. Onigiri can be served as a standalone snack or as part of a Japanese bento box. They are delicious
        on their own or accompanied by soy sauce or other condiments of your choice.
