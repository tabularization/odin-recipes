    <h2>Salmon Avacado Sushi Roll</h2>

    <p>
      The Salmon Avocado Sushi Roll is a delightful combination of fresh ingredients that tantalize the taste buds with every
      bite. This delectable sushi roll features a luscious blend of tender, thinly sliced salmon and creamy avocado, creating
      a perfect harmony of flavors and textures. The vibrant pink hue of the salmon contrasts beautifully with the vibrant
      green of the avocado, making it visually appealing as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The freshness of the salmon shines through, providing a rich and buttery flavor that pairs impeccably with the smooth
      and velvety avocado. The sushi roll is expertly crafted, with the rice acting as a neutral base that allows the flavors
      of the salmon and avocado to take center stage. Each bite delivers a satisfying crunch from the nori seaweed wrapping,
      adding a subtle hint of saltiness to the overall experience.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sushi rice</li>
      <li>Nori seaweed sheets</li>
      <li>Fresh salmon fillet</li>
      <li>Ripe avocado</li>
      <li>Soy sauce</li>
      <li>Wasabi (optional)</li>
      <li>Pickled ginger (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the sushi rice: Cook the sushi rice according to the package instructions. Once cooked, let it cool to room
        temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice the salmon: Cut the fresh salmon fillet into thin slices. Ensure that the slices are of a suitable size to fit
        inside the sushi roll.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice the avocado: Cut the ripe avocado into thin strips. Similar to the salmon, make sure the avocado slices are of
        an appropriate size for the sushi roll.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the rolling station: Lay a bamboo sushi mat on a clean surface. Place a sheet of nori seaweed on top of the
        bamboo mat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread the sushi rice: Take a handful of sushi rice and evenly spread it over the nori seaweed, leaving a small space
        at the top edge of the sheet without rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the fillings: Place the sliced salmon and avocado strips in a line across the middle of the rice-covered nori
        sheet. Make sure the fillings are evenly distributed along the length of the sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll the sushi: Using the bamboo mat as a guide, carefully roll the sushi away from you, applying gentle pressure to
        ensure a tight and compact roll. Wetting the top edge of the nori sheet slightly can help seal the roll.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice the sushi roll: Once the roll is complete, remove it from the bamboo mat and place it on a cutting board. Using
        a sharp knife, slice the roll into bite-sized pieces, typically about 1-inch thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve and enjoy: Arrange the Salmon Avocado Sushi Rolls on a serving platter. Serve with soy sauce, wasabi, and
        pickled ginger on the side for dipping. Enjoy your homemade sushi rolls!
