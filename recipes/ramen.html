<h2>Pork Ramen</h2>

<p>
  The star of the Ramen is the tender and springy ramen noodles, cooked to just
  the right degree of firmness. These noodles effortlessly absorb the aromatic
  broth, delivering a satisfying chewiness in every bite. Complementing the
  noodles are slices of succulent cooked pork, adding a meaty and umami-packed
  element to the dish. The soft-boiled eggs, with their creamy yolks, provide a
  delightful richness, while the nutty sesame oil and the refreshing crunch of
  bean sprouts and earthy mushrooms elevate the complexity of flavors.

    Prepare the broth: In a large pot, bring the chicken or vegetable broth to a
    simmer. Season with soy sauce, salt, and pepper to taste. You can also add a
    dash of sesame oil for additional flavor if desired.

    instructions until they are tender but still slightly firm. Drain and set
    aside.

    Prepare the toppings: Slice the cooked pork (or your preferred protein
    option) into thin slices. Soft-boil the eggs until the yolks are still
    slightly runny. Peel the eggs and cut them in half. Slice the green onions,
    and prepare the nori seaweed sheets by cutting them into thin strips.

    Sauté the mushrooms and bean sprouts: In a separate pan, sauté the sliced

    bean sprouts on top of the noodles.
