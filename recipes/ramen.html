              The star of the Ramen is the tender and springy ramen noodles, cooked to just the right degree of firmness.
              These noodles effortlessly absorb the aromatic broth, delivering a satisfying chewiness in every bite.
              Complementing the noodles are slices of succulent cooked pork, adding a meaty and umami-packed element to the
              dish. The soft-boiled eggs, with their creamy yolks, provide a delightful richness, while the nutty sesame oil
              and the refreshing crunch of bean sprouts and earthy mushrooms elevate the complexity of flavors. Garnished
              with vibrant green onions and delicate strips of nori seaweed, this steaming bowl of Ramen is a feast for both
              the eyes and the palate. Each spoonful offers a symphony of tastes, from the comforting warmth of the broth to
              the satisfying interplay of textures. Whether enjoyed on a chilly day or as a comforting treat, this classic
              Ramen is a bowl of pure comfort and culinary bliss, transporting you to the bustling streets of Japan with its
              authentic and irresistible flavors.

          <h2 class="text-danger">Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Prepare the broth: In a large pot, bring the chicken or vegetable broth to a simmer. Season with soy sauce,
              salt, and pepper to taste. You can also add a dash of sesame oil for additional flavor if desired.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cook the ramen noodles: Boil the ramen noodles according to the package instructions until they are tender but
              still slightly firm. Drain and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prepare the toppings: Slice the cooked pork (or your preferred protein option) into thin slices. Soft-boil the
              eggs until the yolks are still slightly runny. Peel the eggs and cut them in half. Slice the green onions, and
              prepare the nori seaweed sheets by cutting them into thin strips.
            </li>
            <li>
              Saut√© the mushrooms and bean sprouts: In a separate pan, saut√© the sliced mushrooms and bean sprouts in a
              little bit of oil until they are cooked to your desired tenderness. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
            </li>
            <li>
              Assemble the ramen bowls: Divide the cooked ramen noodles into serving bowls. Pour the simmering broth over the
              noodles, ensuring they are fully submerged. Arrange the sliced pork, soft-boiled eggs, saut√©ed mushrooms, and
              bean sprouts on top of the noodles.
            </li>
            <li>
              Garnish and serve: Sprinkle the sliced green onions and nori seaweed strips over the ramen bowls as a final
              touch. You can also add a drizzle of sesame oil for extra flavor. Serve the ramen hot and enjoy!
